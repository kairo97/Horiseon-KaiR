Horiseon is a company that specializes in search engine optimization, Online reputation management, and social media marketing. I have changed <div> tags to modern semantic tags for better readability, optimized CSS by removing redundancy in the code, and changed the webpage to fit on differnt sized viewports by changing value of the content tag to auto.
